Compiling. Most of the difficulty comes from trying to compile openmp code for reduce_to_width_mex.c

Windows
- you might need to install this first: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/52848-matlab-support-for-the-mingw-w64-c-c++-compiler-from-tdm-gcc
- downloaded and installed TDM-GCC 5.1 with openmp enabled (check box during install)
- setenv('MW_MINGW64_LOC','C:\TDM-GCC-64')
- make sure mex -setup points to TDM-GCC
- change directory to mex file directory +big_plot/private
- follow mex instructions in file

Mac
- install homebrew
- in terminal => "brew update xcode-select"
- in terminal => "brew search gcc"
- change directory to mex file directory +big_plot/private
- follow mex instructions in file - may need to update the path to GCC
